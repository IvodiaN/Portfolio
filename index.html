            <p>conditioning affects how we see and react to the world,
              and we often respond unconsciously to this conditioning
              without realizing that we have a choice. Although some
              of our conditioning is necessary and useful, much of it is
              false, negative, and limiting. This is the conditioning
              that causes us suffering and results in our causing
              suffering to others. These false, negative, and limiting
              beliefs and perspectives are what interfere most with
              loving.
